# Grant applications: NSERC's Awards Data
The Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) is a Government of Canada agency that provides grants for research in the natural sciences and in engineering.

NSERC supports postsecondary students and postdoctoral fellows in their advanced studies. The agency promotes discovery by funding postsecondary professors and students and fosters innovation by encouraging Canadian companies to participate and invest in postsecondary research and training.

In this study, I am going to use datasets containing information about several aspects of the grants given by NSERC since 1991. The insights provided through this study will help NSERC itself at the first place to review the programs, policies and guidelies. The results will also benefit the institutions, companies, university and colledge professor and all researchers all around the world, especially in Canada to assess their importance of research, and to identify the trends. It will help them in their futue choice of research or even the place they want to excecute the research.

This study will be just a quick but importnat piece of a bigger projects to review grant/awards applications in Canada, USA and around the world.

Please find the Jupyter notebook in this repository. Everything is explained in the notebook.
